1. **Understanding the `rm` Command**:
    - The `rm` command stands for "remove" and is used to delete files or directories.
    - Basic Syntax:
    ```bash
    rm FILE_NAME
    ```

2. **Removing the File**:
    - We know that the `delete_me` file is present in the home directory so we need to remove it using `rm`.
    - Here’s the command I used:
    ```bash
    hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me
    ```
    
3. **Executing the Required Program**:
   - I executed the `/challenge/check` program to verify the file's removal.
   - Here’s the command I used:
     ```bash
     hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
     ```
     
4. **Capturing the Flag**:
    - After running the command, the terminal displays the flag.
    - Output:
    ```bash
    hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
    Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
